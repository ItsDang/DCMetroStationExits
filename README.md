# DC Metro Station Exits

These data contain the information I used to create [these diagrams](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/15mbos4/i_mapped_the_layouts_of_all_98_metro_stations_so/), which map the layouts of DC Metro stations and their exits.

* meta.csv has info on what the variables mean.

* Doors.csv has a list of x values where a parked train's doors will be.

* Exits.csv has the text of exits for stations with multiple.

* Stations.csv has info about each station.

* Egresses.csv has info about each egress (i.e. icon, in my diagrams).

Let me know if you have ideas on how to improve the dataset!
