# DCMetroStationExits

These data contain the information I used to create [these diagrams](https://www.reddit.com/r/washingtondc/comments/15mbos4/i_mapped_the_layouts_of_all_98_metro_stations_so/) which map the layouts of all 98 Metro stations so you know where to exit the train.

Meta.csv has info on what the variables mean.

Doors.csv has a list of x values where a parked train's doors will be.

Exits.csv has the text of exits for stations with multiple.

Stations.csv has info about each station

Egresses.csv has info about each egress (i.e. icon, in my diagrams)

Let me know if you have ideas on how to improve the dataset!
